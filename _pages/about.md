You love reading? And you also love writing? 
This personal blog is a little personal space where I save some quotes and book excerpts. These have been intense passages which drove me through moments where I lacked answers that no-one could provide.

This collection does not have the pretension to be a world-changer, but merely a little side door to share some rich gifts that offered to me through books and people who crossed my path and left a profound and strong footprint in my life.

I am grateful for all what they gave me, and I believe this humble collection could be my way to return the favour to others.
