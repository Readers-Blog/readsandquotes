You love reading? And you also love writing? 

This little collection is a personal space where I save some quotes and book excerpts. These excerpts have been helping me driving through moments when I was seeking for answers, which no-one could provide.

This collection does not have the pretension to be a world-changer, but merely a little place to store, and a side door to share some rich gifts offered to me through books by some fabulous people who crossed my path and left a profound and strong footprint in my life.

I am grateful to them for all what they gave me. I hope this humble collection could be my way to return the favour to others.
