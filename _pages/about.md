You love reading, and you also love writing, this personal blog is a little personal space where I save some quotes and book excerpts. These have been strong passages whopushed me through moments where I needed answers that no-one could give.

This collection does not have the pretention to be a world changer, but a little side door to share some rich gifts that were offered to me through books and people who crossed my path and left a deep and rich footprint in my life.

I am grateful for all what they gave me and I belive this humble collection could be my way to return the favour to others.
