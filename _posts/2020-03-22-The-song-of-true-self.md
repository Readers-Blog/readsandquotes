Within us there is an inner, natural dignity.  
An inherent worthiness that already knows and enjoys.  
It is an immortal diamond waiting to be mined and is never discovered undesired. 
It is a reverence humming within you that must be honored.  
Call it the soul, the unconscious, deep consciousness, or the indwelling Holly Spirit.  
Call it nothing.  
It does not need the right name or right religion to show itself.  
It does not even need to be understood. It is usually wordless. 

**It just is, and shows itself best when we are silent, or in love or both.**
**I will call it the True Self here.**

It is God-in-All-Things yet not circumscribed by any one thing.  
It is enjoyed only when each part is in union with all other parts, because only then does it stand in the full truth.  
Once in a while, this True Self becomes radiant and highly visible in one lovely place or person.

Superbly so, and for all to see, in the body of the Risen Christ.  
And note that I did say "body." It begins here and now in our embodied state in this world. Thus, the Christ Mystery travels the roads of time.  
Once you have encountered this True Self ― and once is more than enough ― the False Self will begin to fall away on its own.  
This will take most of your life, however, just as it did in Jezus.

― Richard Rohr, "_Immortal Diamond_", pp.56-57
