"We are all allowed to ride life and love's wonderful mystery for a few years ― until  life and love reveal themselves as the same thing [...] ― life morphing into a love that is beyond space and time. 

> He literally "breathes" shalom and forgiveness into the universal air (_John 20:22-23_) 

[...] If the banner that the Christ usually holds in art should say anything, that is what it should say: **_Amor vincit omnia!_** Love will win! Love is all that remains. Love and life are finally the same thing, and you know that for yourself once you have walked through death."

― Richard Rohr, "_Immortal Diamond_", pp.177-178
