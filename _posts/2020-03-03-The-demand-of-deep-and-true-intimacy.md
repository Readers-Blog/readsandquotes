One good thing about celibacy is that it can tell us that an awful lot of sex is not intimacy at all. The good thing about healthy sexuality is that it creates an obvious and ideal container for true intimacy, at least now and then. I wonder how a person who has never practiced risky self-disclosure with at least one other human being would know how to be intimate with God. I sincerely doubt the possibility. (Is this the real meaning of "nakedness"?) Both healthy celibacy and sexual encounter demand **deep and true intimacy**, and both can be the most effective avoidance of it.
