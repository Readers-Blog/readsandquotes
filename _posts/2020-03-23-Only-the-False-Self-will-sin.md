Before transformation, sin is any kind of moral mistake; afterwards, _sin is a mistake about Who you are and Whose you are._ **In that sense, only the False Self can and will sin.** The False Self tells lies because it somehow _is_ a lie. It steals because it has allowed itself to be stolen. [...] The True Self is conscious, the False Self is largely unconscious.

As Jesus said to those who were killing him, 
>[False selves] "do not know what they are doing"  
>(Luke 23:34)
