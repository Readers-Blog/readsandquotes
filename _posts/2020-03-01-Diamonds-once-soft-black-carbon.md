"**Diamonds, once soft black carbon**, become beautiful and radiant white lightning under pressure. The true pattern, the big secret, has now been revealed and exposed "Like a treasure hidden in a field." You did not find the Great Love except by finding yourself too, and you cannot find your True Self without falling into the Great Love."

â€• Richard Rohr, "_Immortal Diamond_", p.185
