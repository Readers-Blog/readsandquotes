> **Diamonds, once soft black carbon**, become beautiful and radiant white lightning under pressure. The true patter, the big secret, has now been revealed and exposed "Like a treasure hidden in a field." You did not find the Great Love except by finding yourself too, and you cannot find your True Self without falling into the Great Love
*― Richard Rohr, "Immortal Diamond" *
