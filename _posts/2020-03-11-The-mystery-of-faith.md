All of creation is saying from the beginning that things live, and things die, and things live again in new shapes. Christians say, "Christ dies, Christ lives, and Christ comes again," and call it "**_The mystery of Faith_**. Buddhists point out the same pattern: "Emptiness is form and form is emptiness." We are both saying the same thing, but with different metaphores ― [the Christian metaphore] is just personal, and [the Buddhist metaphore] is more abstract and philosophical. _We are both saying that all things die and change forms, and nothing is permanent in its present state._

― Richard Rohr, "_Immortal Diamond_", p. 133
