Some spiritually precocious children, usually those with a disability of some type, see through the False Self rather early. Some old men and old women are still dressing it up at ages over their 70s. If all you have at the end of your life is your False Self, there will not be much to eternalize. It is transitory. These costumes are all "accidents" largely created by the mental ego. Your False Self is what changes, passes, and dies when you die. **Only your True Self lives forever.**
