>"Put your finger in the wounds!"
(John 20:27)

In other words, "I am human!" ― which means to be wounded and resurrected at the same time. He returns to his physical body, and yet he is now unlimited by space or time and is without any regret or recrimination.

― Richard Rohr, "_Immortal Diamond_", p.85
