Almost all of our Judeo-Christian history reflects a split from the feminine, which certainly lost us half of the truth. Both sides always lost something good. **This is the very sad result of dualistic thinking**, which is incapable of comprehending, much less experiencing, the mystical, nonviolent, or nondual level of anything ("not totally one but not two either").
