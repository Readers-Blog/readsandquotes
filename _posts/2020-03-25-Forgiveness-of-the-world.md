**You can forgive the outer world only if and when you have first forgiven your own inner world.**

>[Faith is the] "narrow way that few follow upon"  
>(Matthew 7:14)

The True Self never knows with absolutely surety that it is right or "good," but in fact it does not even need to, which is what we mean by "faith." The True Self has knocked on both the hard bottom and the high ceiling of reality and has less and less need for mere verbal certitudes or answers that always fit. It has found its certainty elsewhere and now lives inside a ***YES*** that is so big that it can absorb most of the little _noes_.

The False Self fears and denies all seeming contradictions, probably because it unconciously knows that it is itself a mass of contradictions and is searching for some external order to control.

**You can forgive the outer world only if and when you have first forgiven your own inner world.**
