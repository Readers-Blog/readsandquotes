Place does not exist except in God. There is no time outside God. God is the beauty in all beauty. Those who allow divine friendship enjoy divine friendship, and it is almost that simple. You are that which you are looking for, and that is why you are looking for it. God's life and love flow through you as soon as _you_ are ready to allow it. **That is the core meaning of faith ― to dare to trust** that God could, will, and does have an eternal compassion towards you. Everyone who asked Jesus to heal them or help them had somehow made that simple act of trust that he cared ― and so the flow happened and they were healed. No other preconditions were ever required. It is really rather shocking.
