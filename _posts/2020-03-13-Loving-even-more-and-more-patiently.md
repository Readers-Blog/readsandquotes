God has always loved himself in us, even when we refuse to love and honor ourselves ― just as any parent does with their self-destructive child. In some wonderful and imaginative ways, parents usually love the self-destructive child even more, and more patiently.

>"**I have loved them as much as you loved me**," Jesus says. 
(John 17:23)

Which is a Trinitarian and absolute love. This is an ever-widening ripple of participation until it reaches the furthest edges of the human ― and surely beyond the human to all of creation.
