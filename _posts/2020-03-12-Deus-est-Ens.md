Thomas Aquinas, Bonaventure, and John Duns Scotus thaught the same thing clearly and unequivocally: **"_Deus est Ens_," that is, God is Being itself** (which is different from saying that God is _a_ Being or _all_ Beings). Being did not just start showing itself with the Hindu scriptures, the Koran, or the Judeo-Christian era. If that were the case, God would have been silent, bored, and twiddling God's divine thumbs for a very long time indeed. Surely God was not just waiting for Orthodox Jews, Roman Catholics, and American evangelicals to show up, which is in the last nanosecond of known time.
