[...] _**Every time you choose to love, you have also just chosen to die.**_ Every time you truly love, you are letting go of yourself as an autonomous unit and have given a bit of yourself away to something or someone else, and it is not easily retrieved ― unless you choose to stop loving ― which many do. These first moments of ecstatic release from imprisonment in yourself are wonderful, erotic, and immensely life giving. Eventually, however, when that expanded self wants to retreat back into itself, it realizes it is trapped in a much larger turth now. It has a decision to make: it either expands ― dying to its former small self ― or enfolds back into itself, which is just another and worse kind of dying. But in either case you die.

T.S. Eliot says it more dramatically in the "_Four Quartets_":

>The only, hope or else despair,
>Lies in the choice of pyre or pyre ―
>To be redeemed from fire by fire.

What dies? Your False Self ― and it is just a matter of **when**, not **if**.

Who lives? The God Self that has always lived, but now includes **You**.

N.B.: It is a **What** that dies, and a **Who** that lives!

― Richard Rohr, "_Immortal Diamond_", pp.65-66
