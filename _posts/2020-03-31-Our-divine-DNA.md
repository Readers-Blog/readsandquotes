[...] the True Self is probably larger than the soul, because _it includes Spirit and embodiment too._ Both reveal to us the immortal diamond that God has planted within us, and they often operate as one. 

**Every created thing begins with a divine DNA**, an inner destiny as it were, an absolute core that knows the truth about us, a blueprint tucked away in the cellar of our being, an _imago Dei_ that begs to be allowed, to be fulfilled, and to show itself.

>"It is the Holy Spirit poured into your heart, and it has been given to you."  
>Roman (5.5)

Our True Self is what makes us, us. 

It is like the Risen Presence
