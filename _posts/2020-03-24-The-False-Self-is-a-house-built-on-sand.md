>[The False Selve] "is a house built on sand"  
>(Matthew 7:26)

Fortunately God is willing to work with sand, and created sand too. The sands of life are still the tunnel through which we dig to get to the immortal diamond. You can and will still make mistakes when your home base is the True Self, but you will now see them for what they are ― mistakes ― and be able to apologize and change.

[Yet], it is very important to remember that _the True Self is not moral perfection or even psychological wholeness._

― Richard Rohr, "_Immortal Diamond_", p.51
