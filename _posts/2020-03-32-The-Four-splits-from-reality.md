There are _four major splits_ from reality that we have all made in varying degrees to create our False Self:

1. We split from our shadow self and pretend to be our idealized self.
2. We split our mind from our body and soul and live in our minds.
3. We split life from death and try to live our life without any "death."
4. We split ourselves from other selves and try to live apart, superior, and separate.

Each of these four illusions must ― and will ― be overcome, either in this world, in our last days and hours, or afterward. Each of these splits from reality makes any experience of God or our True Self largely impossible. Spirituality, pure and simple, is overcoming these four splits.
