"**One's biggest secrets and deepest desires are usually revealed to others, and even discovered by ourselves, in the presence of sorrow, failure, or need ― when we are very vulnerable and when one feels entirely safe in the arms of someone's love.** That is why all "little ones" have a huge head start. When vulnerable exchange happens, there is always a broadening of being on both sides. We are bigger and better people afterwards. Those who never go there always remain small and superficial and unconnected to themselves. You would normally experience it as a lack of substance or even reality in a person. People who have avoided all intimacy normally do not know who they are at any depht ― and cannot tell others who _they_ are."

― Richard Rohr, "_Immortal Diamond_", p.165
