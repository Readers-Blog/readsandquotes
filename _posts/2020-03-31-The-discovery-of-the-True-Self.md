I promise you that the discovery of your True Self will feel like a thousand pound of weight have fallen from you back. You will no longer have to build, protect, or promote any idealized self image. Living in the True Self is quite simply a much happier existence, even though we never live there a full twenty-four hours a day. But you henceforth have it as a place to always go back to. You have finally discovered the alternative to your False Self.￼

― Richard Rohr, "_Immortal Diamond_", p. 7
