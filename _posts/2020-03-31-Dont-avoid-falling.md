You do not create your True Self, or earn it, or work up to it by any moral or ritual behaviour whatsoever. It is all and fovever mercy for all of us and all the time, and there are no exceptions. You do not climb up to your True Self. You fall into it, so don't avoid all falling. There, ironically and happily, you are finally found. And you notice your small False Self almost as a disapointing afterthought.
