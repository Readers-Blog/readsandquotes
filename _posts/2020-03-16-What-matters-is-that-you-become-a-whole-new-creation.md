Moralism is the common substitute and counterfeit for mysticism in almost all religions. Moralism (as opposed to healthy morality) is our reliance on largely arbitrary purity codes, magic rituals, and "requirements" for our supposed enlightenment, "salvation," or any form of superiority. Every group and individual relies on moralism in its early stages. We look for something behavioral to _externally do or not do_ rather than undergo a radical transformation _of our very mind and heart._ That would be _la grande mort_, or too big a death. Mature religion is about **Change**, not _little_ changes. Paul states the contrast perfectly when he says to the early Jewish Christians: 

>"It does not matter wether one is circumcised or not, **what matters is that you become a whole new creation.**
(Galatians 6:16)
