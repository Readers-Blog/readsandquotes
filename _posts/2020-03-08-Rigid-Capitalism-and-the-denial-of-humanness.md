C.G. Jung, often very critical of Christianity, said that the "Archetype of the God-Man" (Christ) is a relatively adequate map of the unconscious human journey, and it should not be dismissed until and unless one has walked through it oneself. He feared that Western civilisation would lose this map and that it would be quite dangerous and disastrous for us if we let this map wither in our midst. In that sense, we need an effective "Savior" who can name and guide us on the necessary path. Without a good maps, Jung feared the manipulation, violation, and even "annulment" of the human personality. That sounds like an overstatement until you note the hugely destructive '_-isms_' of our time: totalitarian communism, Nazism, consumerism itself, materialism in general, and what John Paul II called "Rigid Capitalism," all of which deny many of the essentials of humanness, and often our very core.
