Your False Self is who you think you are. [...]

Your False Self is almost entirely a social construct to get you started on your journey.

Your False Self is a set of agreements between your childhood and your parents, your family, your neighbours, your school chums, your partner or spouse, and your religion.

Your False Self is your "container" for your separate self. [...]

Your False Self is how you define yourself outside of love, relationship, or divine union. 

After you have spent many years laboriously building this separate self, with all its labels and preoccupations, you are very attached to it. And why wouldn't you be? It's what you know and all you know. To move beyond it will always feel like losing or dying. Perhaps you have noticed that master teachers like Jesus, and the Buddha, St Francis, all the Teresas (Avila, Lisieux, and Calcutta), Hafiz, Kabir, and Rumi talk about dying much more than we are comfortable with. They all know that if you do not learn the art of dying and letting go early, you will hold onto your False Self too long, until it kills you anyway. 

[...] 

They (_the Missionaries of Charity_) offer a shining witness of radical living in the True Self in a largely False Self world. That is what monks, friars, and nuns were supposed to symbolize in a culture. You are doing the same thing every time you sit in silence, refusing to produce and perform. We call it a "contemplative sit," and do it at least once a day until the False Self shows itself as ephemeral and passing and we are realigned in truth.
