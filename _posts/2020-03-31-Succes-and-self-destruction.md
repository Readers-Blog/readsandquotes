The curiosity about ourselves grows more intense in the teen and young adult years as we try on a dozen costumes and roles, and we surely covet any recognition or praise of our most recent incarnation. We quickly grab it and try it on for size, as if to say, "This might be me!" Some never take their costume off. A too early or too successful self becomes a total life agenda, occasionally for good but more often for ill.

**Think of the many young athletes, musicians, and poets who become obsessed with their identity but never make it to the big time. Even if they do succeed there are too many stories of unhappiness, being lost and self-destruction.** 

Our ongoing curiosity about our True Self seems to lessen if we settle into any "successful" role. We have then allowed others to define us from the outside, although we do not realise it. Or perhaps we dress ourselves up on the outside and never get back inside.
