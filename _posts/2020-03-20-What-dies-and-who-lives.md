In one way or another, almost all religions say that you must die before you die and then you will know what dying means ― and what it does not mean! Your usual viewing platform is utterly inadequate to see what is real. It is largely useless to talk about the very ground of your being, your True Self, or your deepest soul until you have made real contact with these at least once. That demands dying to the old viewing platform of the mental ego and the False Self. There is just no way around that. If you do make contact, you forever know that something is there that can be talked about, relied on, and deeply trusted. You move from religion as mere belief to religion as a new kind of knowing.
